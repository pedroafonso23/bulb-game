This is a simple game I develop to practice what I learned in my first week studing HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Tha app focus mostly on JS, as HTML and CSS are extremlly simple. I wanted to test some logics and play a little bit with some features I learned.

The game rules are simple. When you push START the five bulbs will begin to turn on and off randomly.
Your goal is to click on lit up bulbs to turn them off. Each bulb you turn off adds a point.
If you click on a bulb that is turned off, the bulb will brake and keep broken to the end of the round.
Broken lamps cannot get you ponints, so you should avoid breaking them. 

Enjoy!
